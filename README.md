# ChatBotFromScratch
How I made my Own Chatbot in my Portfolio https://www.sarbzone.com Here is the Tutorial for Every ML Student. Enjoy 🎉🎉🎉

### Motivation
Deploying Python Models is hard and Costly if you choose to deploy it on a server
So I developed a method to train and deploy Models in JavaScript after training partially in Python using JavaScript based Universal Sentence Encoder

## How to Use This Repository to train and deploy your own model ?

>Step 1: Generate Training Data
You can easily train data using 👉NextJS App👈 and
also Export the Embeddings from USE(Universal Sentence Encoder)

> Step 2: Train the model and Convert to JavaScript using 👉ModelTraining.ipynb👈
Train the model as you wish and then convert it to the tfjs format.

>Step 3: Deploy the model using 👉NodeJS_Deployment👈
Copy the JavaScript Model into NodeJs Folder and then import and test Hooray!! 🎉🎉


## Congratulations !! You have made your Own ChatBot and now it's time to deploy it in your website.
